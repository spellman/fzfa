;; macOS Spotlight (mdfind) commands for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `spotlight' is in `fzfa-extensions'
;; (the default) and `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup
;; function is registered — the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-spotlight'        Find any indexed file or .app bundle
;;   `fzfa-spotlight-apps'   Find an installed application
;;   `fzfa-spotlight-audio'  Find audio and play it with the default app

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-spotlight-audio-directories
  '("~/Music" "~/Downloads" "~/Desktop")
  "Directories searched by `fzfa-spotlight-audio'.

Each directory is passed to `mdfind -onlyin'; results are concatenated.
Set to nil to search the whole index."
  :type '(repeat directory)
  :group 'fzfa)

;;;###autoload
(defun fzfa-spotlight ()
  "Find a file system-wide using Spotlight (mdfind).

.app bundles are opened with `open'; all other results open with `find-file'."

    (if (string-suffix-p ".app" result)
        (start-process "default-app" nil "open" result)

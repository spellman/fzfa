;; `ag' (https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `ag' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-ag-files'   Find a file under `default-directory' using ag
;;   `fzfa-ag'         Search file contents under `default-directory' with ag

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-ag-files-command "ag -g ."
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-ag-files'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-ag-command
  "ag --nocolor --nogroup --line-number %s \".\""
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-ag' for content search.

A `%s' placeholder is filled with the max-columns flag derived from
`fzfa-max-line-length'.  Output must be FILE:LINE:CONTENT."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

;;;###autoload
(defun fzfa-ag-files ()
  "Find a file under `default-directory' using ag.

The command is configurable via `fzfa-ag-files-command'."

  (when-let* ((result (fzfa-completing-read
                       :prompt "ag files: " :command fzfa-ag-files-command)))

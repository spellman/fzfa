;;; Commentary:

;; fzfa interface to `company-mode'.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `company' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  Requires the `company' package
;; to be installed and available on `load-path'; it is loaded lazily
;; on first use.
;;
;; In modal-editing states where point sits on a character rather than
;; past it (any evil state besides insert/emacs), the prefix at point
;; is empty and no backend matches.  We move forward by one before
;; starting the session — the prefix `company-complete' would see right
;; after evil's `a' (append) command — and reverse the move on abort.
;;
;; With embark configured, these actions are available on a candidate:
;;
;;   d  show documentation   (`fzfa-company-show-doc')
;;   l  show source location (`fzfa-company-show-location')

  "Fuzzy-select from `company-mode' candidates and complete the selection.

In modal-editing states where point sits on a character (e.g. evil
normal state), both point position *and* the buffer's
`completion-at-point-functions' context need to look like insert
state for backends to fire — capf in particular returns a nil prefix
from non-insert states even after a manual `forward-char'.  So when
invoked from an evil non-insert state, switch into evil insert state
the way `evil-append' would (advance point by one, then enter insert
state), populate candidates, and run the read.  The originating evil
state is always restored on exit (success or abort); on abort, the
original point is restored as well."

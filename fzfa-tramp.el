;;; Commentary:

;; TRAMP support for fzfa.
;;
;; Makes fzfa's shell sources spawn transparently against TRAMP `ssh'
;; paths: for a TRAMP `ssh'-method `default-directory' the shell
;; command is wrapped as `ssh HOST 'cd LOCALNAME && CMD'' and
;; fzf-native is handed a safe local chdir target.  The C-layer's
;; fork+pipe+parallel-score pipeline is unchanged; the remote binary
;; streams over ssh into the same pipe reader as a local process.
;;
;; When `tramp-use-connection-share' is non-nil (Emacs 30 default on
;; non-Windows), TRAMP has already opened a ControlMaster socket for
;; the host, so the wrapped ssh call piggybacks on that socket with
;; no handshake.  With sharing off, each fzfa invocation pays one
;; handshake — acceptable for interactive use.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-ssh'     Pick a host from ~/.ssh/config and visit /ssh:HOST:.
;;   `fzfa-tramp'   Pick a host from ~/.ssh/config and open the browse
;;                  picker on it (via `fzfa-browse-files').

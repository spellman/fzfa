;;; Commentary:

;; Route fzfa's preview into a floating posframe, replacing the buffer-swap
;; behaviour of `fzfa-preview-show'.  Optionally lifts candidates out of the
;; minibuffer into a matching left posframe (telescope.nvim style) when the
;; layout is `side-by-side' and the active frontend supports it.
;;
;; `fzfa-posframe-layout' selects the layout:
;;
;;   preview-centered  Preview posframe sits above the minibuffer, horizontally
;;                     centered.  Candidates stay in the minibuffer.  Default.
;;   side-by-side      Preview posframe pinned to the right edge with margin.
;;                     The candidate pane goes to the left, sourced from
;;                     whichever frontend integration is active:
;;                       vertico   → `vertico-buffer-mode' via vertico-multiform.
;;                       helm      → routed via `helm-display-function' (fzfa
;;                                   supplies its own; only `helm' itself is
;;                                   required).
;;                       ivy       → `ivy-posframe' (MELPA) if installed.
;;                       icomplete → falls back to `preview-centered' — inline
;;                                   icomplete cannot be moved into a buffer.
;;   top-to-bottom     Candidate posframe stacked above the preview posframe,
;;                     both horizontally centered; the combined block is
;;                     vertically centered.  Candidate height tracks the
;;                     frontend's declared candidate count.  Vertico only.
;;
;; Enable with `fzfa-posframe-mode'.  Requires the `posframe' package and a
;; graphical display; enabling on TTY or without `posframe' installed refuses
;; with a `user-error'.

  side-by-side      Preview posframe pinned to the right half of the

                    posframe by the active frontend:

                    centered.  Candidate height tracks the frontend's
                    declared candidate count so the frame is only as
                    tall as it needs to be.

;;; Commentary:

;; Persists `fzfa--sessions' to disk so `fzfa-replay'-class commands
;; can reach past Emacs lifetimes.  Modeled on `recentf':
;;
;;   `fzfa-replay-mode'  Global minor mode.  Enabling it loads the
;;                       on-disk session list, installs an idle
;;                       auto-save timer, and registers a final
;;                       save on `kill-emacs-hook'.
;;
;; The in-memory ring `fzfa--sessions' is captured by `fzfa--read'
;; regardless of this extension — replay-from-memory works without
;; loading anything.  This file adds the disk round-trip.

`fzfa-replay--action' can dispatch.

QUERY is baked into the candidate string rather than tacked on by

Forces left-anchored truncation in `fzfa-vertico' — the
identifying info (DATE / COMMAND / QUERY) lives at the START of
the row, so `fzfa-vertico's default `auto' heuristic (which
treats path-bearing candidates as suffix-anchored) is backwards
here.  Localized via `let' rather than a new per-category
defcustom — we only need this for the two replay pickers, no
need to generalize yet."

;;; Commentary:

;; Multi-source modified-files picker that dispatches to backend-
;; specific commands from vc extensions `fzfa-git' and `fzfa-hg'
;; `vc-responsible-backend' is used for detection
;; only — it is cheap (walks parents looking for `.git' / `.hg' / etc.).
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `vc' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the command is usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-vc-modified-files'      Multi-source picker over the current
;;                                 repo's modified/added/staged/HEAD files
;;   `fzfa-vc-modified-locally'    Single-source: locally modified files
;;   `fzfa-vc-added-files'         Single-source: added (untracked) files
;;   `fzfa-vc-staged-for-commit'   Single-source: staged-for-commit files
;;   `fzfa-vc-modified-in-head'    Single-source: files modified in HEAD
;;
;; The single-source commands dispatch to the appropriate backend
;; entry in `fzfa-vc-modified-files-sources'; the per-source commands
;; themselves live in the backend extensions
;; (`fzfa-git-modified-locally', `fzfa-hg-modified-locally', ...) and
;; can be called directly, bypassing this dispatcher entirely.
;;
;; Supported backends out of the box: Git, Hg.  Extend by adding entries
;; to `fzfa-vc-modified-files-sources'.

of (ID . COMMAND).  ID is a short symbol naming the source (e.g.
`modified-locally', `added-files'); COMMAND is the interactive fzfa

`vc-responsible-backend' walks parent directories and tries every
registered backend's detection; in a multi-source context like
`fzfa-vc-any' the same call fires once per sub-source, adding up
fast.  This session cache lets each unique directory pay the cost
once.

The sentinel `none' caches \"no backend responsible\" so non-VC
directories also short-circuit.  No invalidation — restart Emacs
if a directory's backend changes (`git init', repo move).")

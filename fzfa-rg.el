;; `ripgrep' (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `rg' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-rg-files'   Find a file under `default-directory' using rg --files
;;   `fzfa-rg'         Search file contents under `default-directory' with rg

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-rg-files-command "rg --files"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-rg-files'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-rg-command
  "rg --line-number --no-heading --with-filename %s '' ."
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-rg' for content search.

A `%s' placeholder is filled with the max-columns flag derived from
`fzfa-max-line-length'.  Output must be FILE:LINE:CONTENT.

The trailing `.' explicitly tells rg to search the current directory
— without it, rg reads from stdin when stdin isn't a tty, which
breaks non-interactive invocations (e.g. spawned over ssh)."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

  "Find a file under `default-directory' using rg --files.

The command is configurable via `fzfa-rg-files-command'."

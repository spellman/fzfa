;; `ugrep' (https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `ugrep' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the command is usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-ugrep'   Search file contents under `default-directory' with ugrep

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-ugrep-command
  "ugrep -RIn --no-heading %s ''"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-ugrep' for content search.

A `%s' placeholder is filled with the max-columns flag derived from
`fzfa-max-line-length'.  Output must be FILE:LINE:CONTENT."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

;;;###autoload
(defun fzfa-ugrep ()
  "Search file contents under `default-directory' with ugrep.

Streams all file contents as FILE:LINE:CONTENT; type to
 fuzzy-filter across them.

Selecting a candidate opens the file at that line.
The command is configurable via `fzfa-ugrep-command'."

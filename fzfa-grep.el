;;; Commentary:

;; POSIX `grep' integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `grep' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-grep'                Search file contents under `default-directory'
;;   `fzfa-grep-current-file'   Search the current buffer's file with grep

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-grep-command "grep -Rn ''"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-grep' for content search.

Output must be FILE:LINE:CONTENT."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-grep-current-file-command "grep -vnH '^[[:space:]]*$' %s"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-grep-current-file'.

A `%s' placeholder is filled with the shell-quoted current file path.
Output must be FILE:LINE:CONTENT."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

;;;###autoload
(defun fzfa-grep ()
  "Search file contents under `default-directory' with grep.

Streams all file contents as FILE:LINE:CONTENT; type
 to fuzzy-filter across them.
Selecting a candidate opens the file at that line.
The command is configurable via `fzfa-grep-command'."
  (interactive)
  (when-let* ((r (fzfa-completing-read
                  :command fzfa-grep-command
                  :category 'fzfa-grep
                  :group #'fzfa--grep-group)))
    (fzfa-visit-grep r)))

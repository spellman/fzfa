;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs-internal sources for fzfa: recent files, buffers, the kill
;; ring, bookmarks, themes, TRAMP hosts, and current-buffer /
;; all-buffer line search.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `emacs' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-recent-file'              Find a recently visited file
;;   `fzfa-buffer'                   Switch to an open buffer
;;   `fzfa-yank-pop'                 Yank from `kill-ring' with fzf
;;   `fzfa-bookmark'                 Jump to a bookmark
;;   `fzfa-theme'                    Enable a theme with live preview
;;   `fzfa-tramp'                    Connect to a host from ~/.ssh/config
;;   `fzfa-swiper'                   Search lines of the current buffer
;;   `fzfa-swiper-all'               Search lines across all open buffers
;;   `fzfa-M-x'                      Run an extended command
;;   `fzfa-M-x-for-buffer'           Run an extended command for current mode
;;   `fzfa-minor-mode-menu'          Toggle a minor mode (on/off annotated)
;;   `fzfa-mark'                     Jump to a position in this buffer's marks
;;   `fzfa-global-mark'              Jump to a position in `global-mark-ring'
;;   `fzfa-register'                 Use a register (jump-to or insert)
;;   `fzfa-outline'                  Jump to an outline heading in this buffer
;;   `fzfa-compile-error'            Jump to an error from a compilation buffer
;;   `fzfa-frames'                   Switch focus to another live frame
;;   `fzfa-tabs'                     Switch to a tab on the current frame

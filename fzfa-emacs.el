;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs-internal sources for fzfa: recent files, buffers, the kill
;; ring, bookmarks, themes, and current-buffer / all-buffer line
;; search.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `emacs' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-recent-file'              Find a recently visited file
;;   `fzfa-buffer'                   Switch to an open buffer
;;   `fzfa-yank-pop'                 Yank from `kill-ring' with fzf
;;   `fzfa-bookmark'                 Jump to a bookmark
;;   `fzfa-theme'                    Enable a theme with live preview
;;   `fzfa-font'                     Pick a font family with live preview
;;   `fzfa-man'                      Pick a man page and open it
;;   `fzfa-swiper'                   Search lines of the current buffer
;;   `fzfa-swiper-all'               Search lines across all open buffers
;;   `fzfa-M-x'                      Run an extended command
;;   `fzfa-M-x-for-buffer'           Run an extended command for current mode
;;   `fzfa-apropos'                  Pick a symbol and describe it
;;   `fzfa-descbinds'                Pick a keybinding and describe / execute
;;   `fzfa-complex-command'          Pick from `command-history' and eval
;;   `fzfa-history'                  Pick from comint / eshell input ring
;;   `fzfa-unicode-char'             Pick a Unicode character by name
;;   `fzfa-minor-mode-menu'          Toggle a minor mode (on/off annotated)
;;   `fzfa-mark'                     Jump to a position in this buffer's marks
;;   `fzfa-global-mark'              Jump to a position in `global-mark-ring'
;;   `fzfa-register'                 Use a register (jump-to or insert)
;;   `fzfa-outline'                  Jump to an outline heading in this buffer
;;   `fzfa-compile-error'            Jump to an error from a compilation buffer
;;   `fzfa-ffap-menu'                Pick a file or URL mentioned in this buffer
;;   `fzfa-frames'                   Switch focus to another live frame
;;   `fzfa-tabs'                     Switch to a tab on the current frame

The candidate set is query-independent — fzf does the filtering —
so the obarray walk runs exactly once per producer (i.e. once per
`fzfa-completing-read' session), chunked across timer ticks of
`fzfa-commands-chunk-size' symbols each.  Subsequent producer
calls (which `fzfa--source-fetch' fires on every keystroke) reuse
the cached result via the producer's closure state:

  - Before build completes: call is a no-op; fzf keeps filtering
    against the partial snapshot delivered by the last chunk.
  - After build completes: callback fires synchronously with the
    cached sorted list.

The latest pending callback wins — earlier callbacks are replaced
inside the closure when fzf re-invokes the producer, and the
consumer's `prod-token' check makes the replaced ones harmless."

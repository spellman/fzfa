;; `fd' (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `fd' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the command is usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-fd'   Find a file under `default-directory' using fd

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-fd-command "fd --no-ignore --hidden"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-fd'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

;;;###autoload
(defun fzfa-fd ()
  "Find a file under `default-directory' using fd.

The command is configurable via `fzfa-fd-command'."
  (interactive)
  (when-let* ((result (fzfa-completing-read :command fzfa-fd-command)))
    (fzfa-visit-file result)))

(provide 'fzfa-fd)
;;; fzfa-fd.el ends here

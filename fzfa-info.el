;;; Commentary:

;; fzfa pickers over Info manual indices.  Each manual contributes its
;; index entries as candidates; selection opens the Info viewer at the
;; entry's node.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `info' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-info-emacs'      Pick from the Emacs manual
;;   `fzfa-info-elisp'      Pick from the Emacs Lisp manual
;;   `fzfa-info-org'        Pick from the Org manual
;;   `fzfa-info-cl'         Pick from the Common Lisp manual
;;   `fzfa-info-eieio'      Pick from the EIEIO manual
;;   `fzfa-info-magit'      Pick from the Magit manual (if installed)
;;   `fzfa-info'            Multi-source pick across `fzfa-info-commands'
;;   `fzfa-info-at-point'   Delegate to `info-lookup-symbol' for the
;;                           symbol at point

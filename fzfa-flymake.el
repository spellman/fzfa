;;; Commentary:

;; fzfa interface to Flymake diagnostics.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `flymake' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-flymake'          Jump to a diagnostic in the current buffer.
;;   `fzfa-flymake-project'  Jump to a diagnostic in any buffer of the
;;                           current project.

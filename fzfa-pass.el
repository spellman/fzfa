;;; Commentary:

;; fzfa interface to `password-store' (pass).
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `pass' is in `fzfa-extensions' (the
;; default) and `fzfa-setup' has been called.  Requires the
;; `password-store' package to be installed and available on `load-path';
;; it is loaded lazily on first use.
;;
;; M-x fzfa-pass copies the selected entry's password to the kill ring.
;; With embark configured, these actions are available on a candidate:
;;
;;   c  copy password         (`fzfa-pass-copy')
;;   e  edit                  (`fzfa-pass-edit')
;;   d  delete                (`fzfa-pass-delete')
;;   a  add (using as seed)   (`fzfa-pass-add')
;;   r  rename                (`fzfa-pass-rename')
;;   g  generate              (`fzfa-pass-generate')
;;   u  open url field        (`fzfa-pass-url')

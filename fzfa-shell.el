;;; Commentary:

;; Shell-oriented sources for fzfa: ad-hoc shell commands and shell
;; history lookup.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `shell' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-shell-command'           Fuzzy-search the output of a shell command
;;   `fzfa-shell-project-command'   Same, but run from the project root
;;   `fzfa-shell-history'           Insert / copy a line from shell history

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)
(require 'cl-lib)

(defvar fzfa-shell-command-history nil
  "Minibuffer history for `fzfa-shell-command'.")

COMMAND is passed verbatim to `shell-file-name', so pipes,
redirections, and shell quoting all work as expected.  The selected
candidate is opened as a file if it exists relative to the working
directory; otherwise it is placed in the kill ring."

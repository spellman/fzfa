;; Mercurial (`hg') integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `hg' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the command is usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-hg-files'  Find a tracked file in the current Mercurial repo
;;   `fzfa-hg-modified-locally'  Pick a locally-modified tracked file
;;   `fzfa-hg-added-files'  Pick an unknown (untracked) file
;;   `fzfa-hg-modified-in-head'  Pick a file modified by the parent revision

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-hg-files-command "hg files"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-hg-files'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-hg-modified-locally-command "hg status -n -m"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-hg-modified-locally'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-hg-added-files-command "hg status -n -u"
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-hg-added-files'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."

  "Shell command used by `fzfa-hg-modified-in-head'.

`.' resolves to the working directory's parent revision — i.e., the
most recent commit on the current branch.  Run from `default-directory';
stdout lines become file candidates."

;;; Commentary:

;; POSIX `find' integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `find' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the command is usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-find'   Find a file under `default-directory' using find

;;; Code:

(require 'fzfa)

(defcustom fzfa-find-command "find ."
  "Shell command used by `fzfa-find'.

Run from `default-directory'; stdout lines become file candidates."
  :type 'string
  :group 'fzfa)

;;;###autoload
(defun fzfa-find ()
  "Find a file under `default-directory' using find.

The command is configurable via `fzfa-find-command'."
  (interactive)
  (when-let* ((result (fzfa-completing-read :command fzfa-find-command)))
    (fzfa-visit-file result)))

(provide 'fzfa-find)
;;; fzfa-find.el ends here

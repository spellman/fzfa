;; Helm frontend for `fzfa'.  Loaded automatically when `helm' is in
;; `fzfa-extensions' and `fzfa-setup' has been called.  Once loaded,
;; the two internal entry points (`fzfa-helm--completing-read' and
;; `fzfa-helm--read') are picked up by `fzfa.el's dispatch
;; sites via `fboundp', gated on `helm-mode'.
;;
;; Public source constructors for building helm commands directly:
;;
;;   `fzfa-helm-make-async-source'
;;     Streams candidates from a shell command, filtered live by
;;     fzf-native.  Single producer process; each keystroke rescores
;;     in-memory (no respawn).
;;
;;   `fzfa-helm-make-sync-source'
;;     Scores a fixed list of strings with fzf-native on each
;;     `helm-pattern' change.
;;
;; Both return plain `helm-source-sync' instances with
;; `:match-dynamic t', so they slot into any `(helm :sources ...)'
;; invocation alongside ordinary helm sources.
;;
;;   `fzfa-helm-source-from-command'
;;     Builds a helm source from an existing arg-less `fzfa-*'
;;     command's keyword args.  Lets users compose existing fzfa
;;     commands into helm-mini-style multi-source helm sessions
;;     without restating each source's command / directory / action.

  "Per-source candidate cap inside `fzfa-helm--read'.

`helm' renders every candidate the source returns so we cap it here.
This cap is applied to both the `fzf-native'
`limit' (cuts scoring/list-copy cost) and helm's
`:candidate-number-limit' (cuts rendering cost) for each source in
the multi.  The user can always refine the query to surface entries
ranked below the cap.

Companion var for single-source helm paths is
`fzfa-helm-candidate-limit', which derives its default by scaling
this value (see that defcustom for rationale)."

fires the persistent action when the user presses `C-j' or
`fzfa-preview-key' — matching fzfa's preview-on-demand paradigm
across frontends (vertico/icomplete also wait for the key).

When non-nil, helm sources add `:follow 1', which fires the

  "Wrap APPLY-FN with a stable origin baseline restored on each fire.

DIR / ORIGIN-WINDOW / ORIGIN-BUFFER are captured at session-start.

Helm fires `:persistent-action' in whatever buffer is currently shown
in its persistent-action-display-window.  When the apply is something
like `find-file', the first fire mutates that window (opens Dired for
a directory candidate, opens an unrelated buffer for a file
candidate, etc.).  Every subsequent fire then inherits the mutated
buffer's `default-directory', and `expand-file-name' on a relative
candidate compounds the corruption.  Under `:follow 1' this cascades
into completely bogus paths within one or two scroll steps
\(e.g. nested `user-lisp-30/user-lisp-30/' duplicated path segments).

This wrapper restores the captured origin window/buffer/dir before
each fire — mirroring `fzfa--preview-call''s baseline reset — so the
cascade can't take hold.  The other frontends (vertico/icomplete/ivy)
don't need this because their apply only fires on user keypress and
the candidate is pre-resolved to an absolute path upstream of the
action; helm's `:follow 1' fires apply on every selection move with
the raw candidate string, so the baseline must be re-established
inside the action."

`helm' fires `:persistent-action' on every selection change when

This wrapper closes over a private `preview-timer' + `preview-last'
pair (per-closure, so each `helm' source in a multi gets its own
debounce state) and:

- Reuses any pending timer rather than cancel-and-reschedule.  The
  candidate passed in is ignored — the timer's callback re-reads the
  CURRENT selection via `helm-get-selection' at fire time, so reuse
  never previews a stale candidate.  Mirrors `fzfa--preview-install'
  (fzfa.el:870) and gives identical idle-respecting semantics across
  the two paths.
- Skips dispatch when the freshly-read candidate equals the
  previously-previewed one (no-op moves under `:follow 1').
- Bypasses the debounce when `fzfa-preview-delay' is 0 or less,
  firing immediately (matches the vertico path's escape hatch).

SESSION-CELL, when non-nil, is bound to `fzfa--preview-session'
inside the dispatch — required for the multi handler where each
source has its own session cell and the ambient
`fzfa--preview-session' may point at a different cell (or be nil)
when the idle timer fires.  When nil, dispatch uses the ambient
binding (sync/async paths bind it themselves at the handler

CANDIDATE-NUMBER-LIMIT is `helm''s display cap.

ANNOTATE, when non-nil, is a (CAND) -> STRING function rendered as a

fzfa's `:apply' (persistent-action proper) and takes precedence.
`:follow' tracks `fzfa-helm-want-follow' when APPLY is in use, else
defaults to 1 for PERSISTENT-ACTION.

HISTORY is an optional history variable symbol.  When set and
`helm-pattern' is empty, ITEMS are reordered via `fzfa--history-rank'
so recent picks surface first — helm does not consult the completion
metadata's `display-sort-function', so this sort has to happen at the
candidate level.  HISTORY here governs ORDERING only; pushing the
selection onto HISTORY is the caller's responsibility (the registered
sync/multi handlers wrap their `:action' to do so).

For 2-arg producer ITEMS, `helm-pattern' is split via `fzfa--split'
into (CMD . FILTER) based on DISPLAY state — hidden mode keeps CMD in
source-local closure state (editable region in the minibuffer is pure
FILTER); compact/full materialize CMD into the buffer between
`fzfa-separator' chars.  `fzfa-display-key' (default `>') is bound on
the source's `:keymap' and cycles hidden → compact → full → hidden,
mirroring `fzfa-helm-make-async-source' and the substrate.  For lists
and zero-arg fns there is no CMD concept; `helm-pattern' is the FILTER
directly and DISPLAY is ignored.

Producer-kind detection runs once at source construction (a test fire
with empty input observes whether the callback arrives synchronously).
Async-firing producers (jsonrpc, `url-retrieve') keep their snapshot in
source-local closure state and trigger `helm-force-update' from the
callback so helm re-reads candidates with the fresh snapshot."

Mechanism: CMD is funcalled in fzfa's `:extract' mode to retrieve
its keyword args (`:command', `:directory', `:candidates',
`:history') without running.  The selection is routed back via
fzfa's `:inject' mode so CMD's post-action (e.g. `find-file', grep
jump) runs.  The HIST push that the inner `completing-read' would
have done is mirrored via `add-to-history' wrapping the inject
action.

OVERRIDES is a keyword args plist merged on top of the extracted args
— useful for renaming via :name, swapping :action, repointing
:directory.  OVERRIDES is IGNORED for multi-source commands (which
have N inner sources, no single set of args to override).

Caveat for multi-source commands: each inner source gets its own
polling timer (no shared timer like `fzfa-helm--read' uses).
For pure-fzfa multis with several async sources, `fzfa-multi-read'
is faster.  Composition into helm-mini-style sessions is the
intended use case.

  "Helm dispatch for `fzfa-completing-read'.

Single entry point covering all three source kinds the substrate
supports — `:command' (shell pipeline), `:candidates' as a static
list or zero-arg fn, and `:candidates' as a 2-arg `(INPUT CALLBACK)'
producer fn (sync- or async-firing).  Mirrors the substrate's own
single-entry-point shape.

Source-kind routing:

  :command            → `fzfa-helm-make-async-source' (process pipe).
  :candidates list /  → `fzfa-helm-make-sync-source'.  Whole
    zero-arg fn         `helm-pattern' is the FILTER (no CMD concept).
  :candidates 2-arg   → `fzfa-helm-make-sync-source'.  Producer kind
    fn                  (sync- or async-firing) is detected once at
                        source construction; `helm-pattern' is split
                        via `fzfa--split-input' into (CMD . FILTER).
                        CMD goes to the producer's INPUT slot (refire
                        only when CMD changes); FILTER scores the
                        snapshot via `fzf-native-score-all'.  Async
                        callbacks update a closure-scoped snapshot
                        and schedule `helm-force-update'.

Shared scaffolding: PROMPT, COMMAND, CANDIDATES, CATEGORY, PREVIEW,
APPLY, HISTORY, DEFAULT, DIRECTORY, DISPLAY, SKIP-EXECUTABLE-CHECK
behave as in `fzfa-completing-read'.  ANNOTATE, AFFIX, GROUP,
REQUIRE-MATCH are accepted for signature parity but unused — helm
sources don't consume completion-read metadata.

PREVIEW (with CATEGORY for registry lookup) wires the preview
lifecycle — handler resolved via `fzfa--preview-handler', session
state captured manually (helm doesn't go through
`minibuffer-with-setup-hook' so `fzfa--preview-install' can't be
used), `:setup' fires before helm activates, `:exit' + `:return'
fire on exit.  Live preview during the session (firing `:preview'
on selection movement) wires up via `:persistent-action' +
`:follow 1' when handler is set and APPLY is not — APPLY otherwise
wins the persistent-action slot.

Bypasses `completing-read' (and therefore helm-mode's advice) so
per-history candidate ordering can land at the candidate level —
helm doesn't consult the metadata `display-sort-function' that
vertico / icomplete rely on.  Side effect: bypassing
`completing-read' also bypasses its HIST push, so the action wraps
`add-to-history' to mirror what would have happened."

  "Helm dispatch for `fzfa--read'.

SOURCES is the same list of plists as the `completing-read' path.
PROMPT is the prompt string shown in the helm session.
NARROW-IDX, when non-nil, seeds the active narrow at session
start to that source index — used by `fzfa-replay' to replay a
session that exited narrowed.  Nil restores the default (N=1
always narrows to 0, N>1 starts widened).
Each `fzfa' source maps to a `helm' source:
  :command     -> async (eager-start, no per-source polling timer)
  :candidates  -> sync (fzf-native-score-all on each `helm-pattern'
                  change).  Producer kind is detected once at source
                  construction; async-firing producers (jsonrpc etc.)
                  keep their snapshot in source-local closure state and
                  trigger `helm-force-update' on callback arrival.

A SINGLE shared polling timer watches every async handle and calls
`helm-force-update' at most once per `fzfa-input-throttle' seconds
when any source has new candidates.

Cursor follows the highest-ranked source: each source's `:candidates'
closure stores its top-fzf-score in a `ranks' vector, and a
`helm-after-update-hook' calls `helm-goto-source' on the leader when
it changes.  Replaces helm's default \"first non-empty source\"
positioning, which is declared-order-arbitrary and structurally wrong
for fuzzy-multi-source UX."

;; Embark integration for fzfa.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `embark' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  The wiring (sub-keymap on
;; `embark-general-map' under the `Z' prefix plus a handful of
;; target-specific bindings) only runs after the `embark' feature is
;; loaded.
;;
;; Global prefix: `Z' on `embark-general-map' opens the full fzfa
;; action palette regardless of target type.
;;
;; Per-target direct bindings.  Keys are chosen to avoid clobbering
;; embark defaults — notably `S' (`embark-collect'), `A'
;; (`embark-act-all' / `align-regexp'), and `R' (`repunctuate-sentences'
;; on region, `byte-recompile-directory' on file).  The
;; backend-specific bindings (rg/grep/ag/ugrep) collapse into a single
;; `G' = `fzfa-smart-grep' that dispatches to whichever backend is on
;; PATH; the full per-backend palette stays reachable via `Z'.
;;
;;   region / identifier maps (plain command; target flows into the fzf
;;   filter via embark's minibuffer-injection mechanism + the
;;   `embark--allow-edit' / `embark--unmark-target' pre-action hooks
;;   installed by `fzfa-embark-setup'):
;;     G smart-grep
;;   file / buffer / email maps (wrappers that switch context — buffer
;;   or rewrite the search query — based on the target type):
;;     file:    G grep-this-file
;;     buffer:  I imenu-in-buffer, J swiper-in-buffer
;;     email:   N notmuch, T notmuch-tree
;;   flymake map (plain commands; act as re-picks):
;;     F flymake, P flymake-project

;; These are for targets where the embark target is NOT a filter query —
;; it's a buffer, file path, or email address — and the wrapper has to
;; switch context (current buffer, `default-directory', notmuch query
;; syntax) before invoking the underlying fzfa command.  For region /
;; identifier targets where the target IS the desired fzf filter, no
;; wrapper is needed; embark's pre-action hooks (installed below) inject
;; the target directly into the fzf minibuffer.

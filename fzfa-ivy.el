;;; Commentary:

;; Ivy frontend for `fzfa'.  Loaded automatically when `ivy' is in
;; `fzfa-extensions' and `fzfa-setup' has been called.  Loading this
;; file alone is a no-op; `fzfa-ivy-setup' — called from `fzfa-setup'
;; — defers its work via `with-eval-after-load' on `ivy' so the
;; registrations kick in only when ivy is actually loaded.
;;
;; Single-source fzfa-async and fzfa-sync already handle ivy
;; correctly in fzfa.el itself — they bind
;; `ivy-completing-read-dynamic-collection t' so ivy skips its
;; re-builder filter and trusts the fzf-scored output.  This
;; extension is for the multi-source path, which needs:
;;
;;   - A display transformer so the user can tell which source each
;;     candidate came from (ivy ignores the `group-function'
;;     completion-metadata key that vertico/icomplete read).
;;
;;   - A push closure that re-scores async sources against `ivy-text'
;;     on each pattern change.  ivy's push model means typing doesn't
;;     re-call the collection function, so without this async sources
;;     stay stuck on the pattern they were first invoked with.

invoked on the current candidate without exiting.  All other sessions
\(and any non-identity action chosen via `ivy-dispatching-call', like
the per-source narrow actions that `fzfa--read' installs) pass
through unchanged via (apply ORIG ARGS)."

  ;; caller's `find-file' / `switch-to-buffer' never runs.

  ;; Also gated on the current action being the identity default.
  ;; `ivy-dispatching-call' mutates `ivy-state-action' to point at the
  ;; chosen action triple before invoking `ivy-call'; if we replaced

;;; Commentary:

;; Hungry variants: derive the search scope from every file-visiting
;; buffer's parent directory (deduplicated so a shallower parent
;; subsumes its descendants), then stream a single command across all
;; of them.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `hungry' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-hungry-find'     Find files across derived directories (fd / find)
;;   `fzfa-hungry-swiper'   Grep file contents across derived directories
;;                          (rg / grep)

  "Remove duplicates and subdirectory entries from DIRS.

If directory A is a prefix of directory B, B is dropped — A's recursive
search already covers it.  Exception: B is kept when it is itself a git
root (contains a .git entry), so rg's gitignore stack starts at B rather
than inheriting A's.  Git-specific — rg only honors .gitignore, so .hg
/ .jj / etc. would just add duplicate hits."

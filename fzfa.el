;;; Commentary:

;; Provides async shell command completion using fzf-native for scoring.
;; The native layer handles process I/O on a background thread, ANSI
;; stripping, and parallel fzf scoring.  The Elisp layer provides
;; while-no-input responsiveness, a candidate cap, and a live stats overlay.
;;
;; Quick start:
;;   (fzfa-setup)   ; register completion style + category override
;;   (fzfa-find-files)

  "Run `completing-read' with fzf-native scoring over COMMAND or CANDIDATES.

Exactly one of :COMMAND or :CANDIDATES selects the source kind:

  :COMMAND     Shell command whose stdout lines become candidates.
  :CANDIDATES  Static list, zero-arg function returning a list, or a
               2-arg producer fn `(lambda (INPUT CALLBACK) ...)' that
               populates a snapshot per-keystroke.  Lists and zero-arg
               fns are auto-wrapped into constant producers.

The minibuffer input is split into a CMD part and a FILTER part on
`fzfa-separator': the buffer text has shape \"<sep>CMD<sep>FILTER\".
Changing CMD restarts the subprocess (for COMMAND sources) or refires
the producer (for CANDIDATES sources); changing FILTER rescores in
place via fzf-native against the current snapshot.

:DISPLAY controls how much of the CMD region is visible.  Press
`fzfa-display-key' (default \">\") to cycle:
  hidden  — entire \"<sep>CMD<sep>\" prefix is invisible; only FILTER
            appears editable.  Default for shell COMMAND sources.
  compact — flags within CMD collapse behind ` ... '; program name
            and the trailing argument slot remain visible.
  full    — whole \"<sep>CMD<sep>FILTER\" string is shown verbatim.

:PROMPT                 Minibuffer prompt.  Derived from the first token of
                        COMMAND (e.g. \"find: \" for \"find .\") when omitted;
                        falls back to \"fzf > \" for CANDIDATES sources.
:COMMAND                Shell command whose stdout lines become candidates.
                        Pre-inserted into the minibuffer as
                        \"<sep>COMMAND<sep>\".  Mutually exclusive with
                        :CANDIDATES.
:CANDIDATES             List, zero-arg fn, or 2-arg producer (see above).
                        Mutually exclusive with :COMMAND.
:DIRECTORY              Working directory for COMMAND.  Defaults to
                        `fzfa--default-dir' (respects
                        `fzfa-project-backend').
:CATEGORY               Completion category symbol.  Defaults to
                        `fzfa-file' for :COMMAND, `fzfa-misc' for
                        :CANDIDATES.  Common explicit values: `fzfa-grep'
                        for FILE:LINE:CONTENT, `fzfa-buffer' for
                        `buffer-name' pickers, `fzfa-bookmark' for
                        bookmarks, etc.
:ANNOTATE               Optional (CANDIDATE) -> string function exposed as
                        `annotation-function' completion metadata.
                        Annotations render immediately after each candidate.
:AFFIX                  Optional (CANDIDATES) -> ((CAND PREFIX SUFFIX) ...)
                        function exposed as `affixation-function'.  Prefer
                        this over :ANNOTATE when column alignment matters.
:GROUP                  Optional (CANDIDATE TRANSFORM) -> string function
                        exposed as `group-function' completion metadata.
                        Renders section headers in vertico/icomplete.
:HISTORY                Optional history variable symbol passed to
                        `completing-read'.  Selected entries are pushed onto
                        this list; under ivy the empty-FILTER candidate
                        ordering also reflects this history's recency.
:REQUIRE-MATCH          Forwarded to `completing-read'.  Defaults to nil
                        for :COMMAND (free-form input — `fzfa-find'
                        accepts a new path), t for :CANDIDATES (must
                        pick a listed entry).  Pass an explicit nil or
                        t to override.
:DEFAULT                Forwarded to `completing-read'.  Returned when the
                        user submits empty input; also seeded into history.
:INITIAL-INPUT          Optional initial minibuffer text overriding the
                        auto-built \"<sep>COMMAND<sep>\".  Either a string
                        or (TEXT . POSITION) cons with 0-based cursor
                        offset.
:RESOLVE-PATHS          When non-nil, the returned candidate is passed
                        through `expand-file-name' against :DIRECTORY
                        before returning.  Defaults to t for :COMMAND
                        sources, nil for :CANDIDATES.  Pass an explicit
                        t or nil to override.
:DISPLAY                Initial display mode (`hidden', `compact', or
                        `full'); see above.
:SKIP-EXECUTABLE-CHECK  When non-nil, skip the `executable-find' guard
                        on the first token of COMMAND.  No-op for
                        :CANDIDATES sources (no command to check).
:PREVIEW                Per-call live-preview handler that bypasses the
                        `fzfa-preview-functions' registry lookup for
                        CATEGORY.  Pass a (CAND) -> any function for a
                        simple preview-only handler, or a full handler
                        plist with `:setup', `:preview', `:exit', `:return'
                        slots.  Nil falls back to the registry.  Set both
                        `fzfa-preview-delay' and `fzfa-preview-key' to
                        nil to disable previews.
:APPLY                  Lambda (CAND) -> any.  Runs without exiting the
                        session.  Invoked by `fzfa-apply-key' (under
                        vertico / icomplete), `ivy-call' (ivy), or
                        `helm-execute-persistent-action' (helm).  When
                        omitted, falls back to the category default in
                        `fzfa-apply-functions'.

The prompt overlay shows: DIR IDX/[FILTERED](TOTAL)
  DIR      — abbreviated working directory (omitted for CANDIDATES sources)
  IDX      — current selection index (omitted for frontends without one)
  FILTERED — candidates matching the current query
  TOTAL    — total candidates collected so far"

SOURCES is a list of plists.  Each source contributes a labeled group of

falls back to declared source order.

  :command     Shell command string.  Mutually exclusive with

  :candidates  List of strings, a zero-arg fn returning one, or a
               2-arg `(lambda (INPUT CALLBACK) ...)' producer.  Lists
               and zero-arg fns are wrapped as constant producers via
               `fzfa--normalize-candidates'.  Mutually exclusive with
               :command.
  :directory   Working directory for :command (default
               `default-directory').
  :annotate    Optional (CAND) -> string annotation function.
  :action      Optional (CAND) -> any.  Called with the selection.
               When omitted, the raw selection string is returned.
  :history     Optional history variable symbol.  When set, the cleaned
               selection (tofu suffix stripped) is pushed via
               `add-to-history' on exit — mirroring the HIST push the
               source's own `completing-read' would have done.  On
               empty input, the source's candidate slot is additionally
               reordered by this history so recent picks surface first.
               Static-list sources extracted from existing `fzfa-*'
               commands inherit this from each source's
               `fzfa-completing-read' :history argument."

active narrow at exit (nil = widened).  LAST-QUERY is the most

Dedup: before pushing, any existing session with the same
\(command, directory, narrow-idx, filter) key is removed.  Five
identical \\[fzfa-fd]'s from the same dir with the same query
collapse into one — keeping the in-memory ring meaningful and
preventing the on-disk file from accumulating duplicates.

Exclusion: when ENTRY-COMMAND is in `fzfa-sessions-exclude-commands'

themselves out of the ring (replaying a replay is confusing) and
to drop helm's exit dispatcher (`helm-maybe-exit-minibuffer')

Each entry in COMMANDS is either a bare command symbol or a list

Each command is funcalled twice per multi session — once in
`:extract' mode (capture keyword args, abort), once in `:inject' mode after
the user picks (so the command's post-action runs).  OPTIONS is forwarded
to `fzfa--read'.  Commands whose body does not reach
`fzfa-completing-read' are skipped.
Commands must be arg-less (no interactive `read-*' prompts in their body).

Composes: if a command in COMMANDS itself calls `fzfa--read'
\(e.g. `fzfa-find-any'), its inner sources are flattened in alongside
the other commands' sources, with each inner source keeping its own
:action.  Explicit :narrow on a nested-multi entry is ignored —
inner sources receive auto-derived keys from their own :name."

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides async shell command completion using fzf-native for scoring.
;; The native layer handles process I/O on a background thread, ANSI
;; stripping, and parallel fzf scoring.  The Elisp layer provides
;; while-no-input responsiveness, a candidate cap, and a live stats overlay.
;;
;; Quick start:
;;   (fzfa-setup)   ; register completion style + category override
;;   (fzfa-find-files)

\\[fzfa-apply-current] visit survives that reversion.

Implementation: `minibuffer-exit-hook' fires BEFORE the unwind's
window restoration, so a synchronous `set-window-buffer' inside the

0 nil' from within the exit hook so the set fires at the next event
loop tick, after the unwind has fully drained.

On commit, the calling command's post-`completing-read' body runs

The C-side destroy does pthread_join on the scoring thread
\(uninterruptible snapshot/score work for huge pools) and frees the

None of it is needed before minibuffer dismissal, so deferring this

rhythm in trade for holding the arena slightly longer.

  hidden  — entire \"<sep>CMD<sep>\" prefix is invisible; only FILTER

  compact — flags within CMD collapse behind ` ... '; program name
            and the trailing argument slot remain visible.
  full    — whole \"<sep>CMD<sep>FILTER\" string is shown verbatim.

:PROMPT                 Minibuffer prompt.  Derived from the first token of

:DIRECTORY              Working directory for COMMAND.  Defaults to
                        `fzfa--default-dir' (respects
                        `fzfa-project-backend').
:CATEGORY               Completion category symbol.  Defaults to
                        `fzfa-file' (most async commands return file
                        paths).  Pass `fzfa-grep' for FILE:LINE:CONTENT
                        candidates, `fzfa-misc' for non-file output, etc.
:GROUP                  Optional grouping function for completion metadata.
:INITIAL-INPUT          Optional initial minibuffer text overriding the
                        auto-built \"<sep>COMMAND<sep>\".  Either a string
                        or (TEXT . POSITION) cons with 0-based cursor

                        commands that return non-path output (e.g. shell
                        output where the raw text matters).
:DISPLAY                Initial display mode (`hidden', `compact', or
                        `full'); see above.
:SKIP-EXECUTABLE-CHECK  When non-nil, skip the `executable-find' guard on
                        the first token of COMMAND.
:PREVIEW                Per-call live-preview handler that bypasses the

  "Run `completing-read' over CANDIDATES using fzf-native for scoring.

:CANDIDATES List of strings to score with `fzf-native-score-all'.
:PROMPT     Minibuffer prompt string.  Defaults to \"fzf > \".
:CATEGORY   Completion category symbol.  Defaults to `fzfa-misc'.
            Use `fzfa-file' for file-path candidates so marginalia
            can annotate them with file metadata.
:ANNOTATE   Optional function (CANDIDATE) -> string appended after each
            candidate.  Exposed as `annotation-function' in completion
            metadata.  Annotations start immediately after the candidate
            string, so column alignment depends on candidate widths.
:AFFIX      Optional function (CANDIDATES) -> list of (CANDIDATE PREFIX
            SUFFIX).  Exposed as `affixation-function'.  Vertico
            right-pads each candidate to a consistent width before
            appending SUFFIX, giving true column alignment.  Prefer this
            over :ANNOTATE when alignment matters.
:GROUP      Optional function (CANDIDATE TRANSFORM) -> string.  When
            TRANSFORM is nil return the group name; when non-nil return
            the display string for CANDIDATE within its group.  Frontends
            like vertico render group headers between sections.
:HISTORY    Optional history variable symbol passed to `completing-read'.
            Selected entries are pushed onto this list and recallable
            with \\[previous-history-element].
:REQUIRE-MATCH Forwarded to `completing-read'.  Defaults to t.  Set nil
            to accept free-form input (treat CANDIDATES as suggestions).
:DEFAULT    Forwarded to `completing-read'.  Returned when the user
            submits empty input; also seeded into history.
:PREVIEW    Per-call live-preview handler that bypasses the
            `fzfa-preview-functions' registry lookup for CATEGORY.
            Pass a function that takes a CAND for a simple preview-only
            handler, or a full handler plist with `:setup',
            `:preview', `:exit', `:return' slots.  Nil (the default)
            falls back to the registry.  Set `fzfa-preview-delay' to nil
            to disable previews.
:APPLY      Lambda (CAND) -> any.
            See `fzfa-async-completing-read' for semantics."

callers stash this in the outer preview session so per-candidate
dispatch outside the router (e.g. `fzfa--promote-from-preview' on a

  "Run `completing-read' across multiple SOURCES, fzfa style.
PROMPT is shown in the minibuffer.

Internal — users should call `fzfa-multi-read' which derives sources
from existing single-source commands.  This function takes pre-built
source plists directly.

SOURCES is a list of plists.  Each source contributes a labeled group of
candidates; group order is recomputed on every keystroke from each
group's top fzf score, so the strongest-matching group floats to the
top.  Within a group, candidates stay in fzf order.  An empty query
falls back to declared source order.

Per-source plist keys:
  :name      Group header (required).
  :items     Sync items: list of strings, or zero-arg function returning one.
             Mutually exclusive with :command.
  :command   Async source: shell command string.
  :directory Working directory for :command (default `default-directory').
  :annotate  Optional (cand) -> string annotation function.
  :action    Optional (cand) -> any.  Called with the selection.  When
             omitted, the raw selection string is returned.
  :history   Optional history variable symbol.  When set, the cleaned
             selection (tofu suffix stripped) is pushed via
             `add-to-history' on exit — mirroring the HIST push that
             would have happened if the source's own `completing-read'
             had run.  On empty input, the source's candidate slot is
             additionally reordered by this history so recent picks
             surface first.  Sync sources extracted from existing

  "Run a multi-source completing-read over COMMANDS.
Each entry in COMMANDS is either a bare command symbol or a list
\(COMMAND :narrow KEY) overriding the auto-derived narrow key for
that source (KEY is a single character — symbol, ?char, or string).

Each command is funcalled twice per multi session — once in
`:extract' mode (capture keyword args, abort), once in `:inject' mode after
the user picks (so the command's post-action runs).  OPTIONS is forwarded
to `fzfa--multi-read'.  Commands whose body does not reach
`fzfa-async-completing-read' or `fzfa-sync-completing-read' are skipped.
Commands must be arg-less (no interactive `read-*' prompts in their body).

Composes: if a command in COMMANDS itself calls `fzfa--multi-read'
\(e.g. `fzfa-find-any'), its inner sources are flattened in alongside
the other commands' sources, with each inner source keeping its own
:action.  Explicit :narrow on a nested-multi entry is ignored —
inner sources receive auto-derived keys from their own :name."

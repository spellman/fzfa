;;; Commentary:

;; fzfa interface to notmuch.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `notmuch' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  Requires the `notmuch' Emacs
;; package and the `notmuch' CLI on `exec-path'; both are loaded lazily
;; on first use.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-notmuch'        Search threads, open in `notmuch-show'
;;   `fzfa-notmuch-tree'   Search threads, open in `notmuch-tree'
;;
;; With embark configured, these actions are available on a candidate:
;;
;;   s  show thread          (`fzfa-notmuch-show-thread')
;;   t  open in tree view    (`fzfa-notmuch-tree-thread')

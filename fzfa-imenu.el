;;; Commentary:

;; `fzfa' pickers over imenu indices, single-buffer and multi-buffer.
;;
;; Loaded automatically when `imenu' is in `fzfa-extensions' and
;; `fzfa-setup' has been called.  No setup function is registered —
;; the commands are usable immediately.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   `fzfa-imenu'                  Jump to an imenu entry in this buffer
;;   `fzfa-imenu-all'              Jump to an imenu entry across buffers
;;   `fzfa-imenu-all-but-current'  Like `fzfa-imenu-all' but skip current

  "Implementation of `fzfa-imenu' / `fzfa-imenu-all'.

SCOPE selects which buffers to walk:
  nil / `current'  — just the current buffer.
  `all'            — every live non-internal buffer.
  `others'         — every live non-internal buffer except the current one.

Display differences:
- Single buffer: display = NAME (with \"(CATEGORY)\" appended on
  cross-category name collision); group header = imenu category.
- Multi buffer:  display = \"[CATEGORY] NAME\" (no collision possible —
  entries are already partitioned by buffer); group header = buffer name."
